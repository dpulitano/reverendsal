Reverend Sal Pulitano is an experienced fully-ordained interfaith minister who specializes in helping you create a beautiful ceremony to celebrate your love. He performs all types of wedding ceremonies including Civil Weddings, Non-denominational, Traditional, Interfaith Ceremonies, Second Marriages, Non-Traditional Weddings, Themed weddings, Renewal of Vows and Same Sex Marriages.

He will consult with you prior to the ceremony to discuss the venue, your preferences and the format. Together we’ll design a plan so you can tell everyone through your own words how you fell in love and why you want to be married. Share your personal story to create something unique which is limited by your imagination or use one of my standard ceremonies.

You’ll need your wedding license and two witnesses. Rings are optional. The license must be from the Bride’s hometown if she is a NJ resident or the Groom’s hometown if he is a NJ resident, or the town of the ceremony if neither is a resident.

Same-sex marriage in New Jersey has been legally recognized since October 21, 2013, the effective date of a trial court ruling invalidating the states restriction of marriage to person of different genders.  Reverend Sal is friendly to the LGBTQ community and welcomes anyone of legal age who desires to get married in NJ/NY/PA.
